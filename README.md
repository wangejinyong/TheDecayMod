# ** The Decay Mod **

## This is a "lightweight" Mindustry mod. 
The mod aim to expand on the missing energy part of the vanilla game, adding some generators and something related to the energy system in the game. 

**Most generators will have their own unique mechanics.** 

For modders: I'm weak in coding. If any part of the codes disgusts you, I didn't mean to do it. If you are willing to assist me, I will gladly accept it!

For players: If you like this mod and want to see how this mod develops in the future, you can pay attention to this [Github page](https://github.com/wangejinyong/TheDecayMod/tree/master), thank you very much for liking my mod!


**I will try my best to make the mod vanilla friendly!**

### Finally,have fun!!!
